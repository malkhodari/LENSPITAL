#### A Professional and Interactive Social Media Platform for Medicine

Promoting Patient-Specific Awareness and Monetizing Your Healthcare Data

## Inspiration
Decentralized social graph platforms hold so much potential to enable privacy-focused precision medicine and federated learning without relying on mega-corporations. Statistically speaking, Health and Fitness app users number around 385 million worldwide, 2/3rds of US hospitals offer mobile health apps based interventions and 90% of physicians already use smartphones at work for patient follow-ups.

Smart devices track heart rate, heart rhythms, blood pressure, movement, and workout behavior, and many are connected to device-specific APIs such as Samsung Health/Apple Health. With such large-scale data collections allowing for studying population health at scale, we believe that a person's self-generated data is their own unique digital medical footprint, their quantified self in cyberspace.

We envision a social garden where, as the patients automatically and continuously generated health data and their social connections grow, they should possess the ability to both generate revenue from their recorded data, and also opt-in for browser-based AI models' screening results in the short and long term.

## Problem Statement
- Lack of professional social media platforms for healthcare
- Gap in communication during a crisis with medical misinformation
- Lack of awareness about personalised healthcare 

## Current Situation
- Facilitating patients’ access to current and predicted health conditions, by learning from their uploaded data, as well as their posting behavior. This is completely optional, and the user can choose to only receive royalties for providing anonymized routine health data without having to receive any clinical AI support prognosis!

- Engaging people in public health and healthcare discussions, with top (true) posts being minted as NFT collections and increasing chances of adoption (i.e vaccinations)! Allow the collective knowledge of professionals to disseminate actively and passively with impact on a distributed social platform, oriented to those who are either patients or interested in the topics.

- Spreading healthcare awareness with accurate medical information, and combating misinformation associated with traditional, boring, web2 social media (looking at you, Twitter). Thus, we aim to support doctors, healthcare workers, and medical influencers with monetization for promoting/verifying claims!

All this in one interactive Web3 game-like interactive platform (one day soon but there is a sneak peek for you :)).
## What it does
- Engaging people in public health and healthcare discussions
- Spreading healthcare awareness with accurate medical information
- Facilitating patients’ access to current and predicted health conditions
- Supporting doctors, patients, and medical influencers with monetization

## How we develop it

- LENS API
- Python
- Neural Networks
- Figma

## Challenges we ran into
Bringing the idea to life in less than 24 hours, in an actionable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing manner. After about 5 hours of playing around with APIs and frameworks, we decided that the idea and its user journey are worth more as an NFT than some boilerplate code stitched together just to be abandoned post 3 pm today... 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As we are primary researchers, being 1st Year DPhil Candidates, we discovered the importance of having a healthcare/fitness component, even as an optional plugin, to learn from the myriad of data that is being generated on a daily basis and the social connections to find like-minded supported groups.

We programmed a prototype for the media platform and the interactive environment which outlines patient trajectories and organic discovery on decentralized social graphs.

    - Building a working platform built on the fundamental principles of the LENS domain.

    - Developing a prototype of how a next-level social media platform with fun quirky components and clinical potential should look like.

    - Enriching the medical value and computer programming within the era of web3 social media.


## What we learned
- Collaborative team work
- Active programming, which is programming on-the-go
- Developing actively working tools with minimum supervision

## What's next for LENSPITAL
- Further development on the prototype
- Enhancing its features to simplify the integration of the healthcare sector within social media
- Ensure HIPAA-compliance for data storage
- Hash/Secure the User Identity
- Find Non-Vendor Locked APIs for Healthcare Data for Connecting Smart Devices
- POC/Pilot Study with Patients and Doctors to See Real-Life Value
