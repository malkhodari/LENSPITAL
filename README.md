## Inspiration
LENSPITAL is the next-level social media platform specialised for professional and interactive healthcare. Ever thought of hearing misinformation about diseases especially during a crisis and becoming able of filtering them out through trusted social media influencers? LENSPITAL gathers all medical professionals, patients, and public audience to discuss and share healthcare news, thoughts, information, and data. Plus, it transforms regular social media to a more dynamic environment where users get to look into their future health conditions as well as others' and share with them their past experiecnes and thoughts! All in one interactive Web3 game-like interactive platform.

## Problem Statement
- Lack of professional social media platforms for healthcare
- Gap in communication during a crisis with medical misinformation
- Lack of awareness about personalised healthcare 

## Current Situation
- Health and Fitness apps users are around 385 million worldwide
- Two-thirds of US hospitals offer mobile health apps
- Around 90% of physicians already use smartphones at work
- Revenue increased by 54% especially during lockdown

## What it does
- Engaging people in public health and healthcare discussions
- Spreading healthcare awareness with accurate medical information
- Facilitating patients’ access to current and predicted health conditions
- Supporting doctors, patients, and medical influencers with monetization

## How we develop it

- LENS API
- Python
- Neural Networks

## Challenges we ran into
- Bringing the idea into life in less than 24 hours
- Programming a prototype for the social media platform and the interactive environment

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Jayroop and Mohanad are 1st year DPhil students that started only a month ago
- Building a working platform related to the LENS domain
- Developing a prototype of how next-level social media platform should look like
- Enriching the medical value and computer programming within the era of social media

## What we learned
- Collaborative team work
- Active programming, which is programming on-the-go
- Developing actively working tools with minimum supervision

## What's next for LENSPITAL
- Further development on the prototype
- Enhancing its features to simplify the integration of the healthcare sector within social media
